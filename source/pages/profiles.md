#### Profiles

The PRO FHIR IG does not define any specific new profiles, but rather uses the profiles defined by SDC. The following is a list of the SDC profiles and the purposes for which they are used within the PRO IG. Please refer to the [Capability Statements](capstatements.html) and [Implementation Guidance](guidance.html) for usage of these profiles.
