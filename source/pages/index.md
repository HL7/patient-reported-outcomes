###  Introduction

The Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) will focus on capturing and exchanging patient reported outcome data electronically using the FHIR standard. The data that is captured will be made available to both providers and authorized researchers. While the PRO FHIR IG can be applied to multiple use cases, the current requirements have been drawn from [PCORnet] use cases and implementations. The capabilities described as part of the IG are intended to be leveraged to build US data infrastructure for a Learning Health System (LHS).

PRO FHIR IG will leverage the US-Core IG and profiles for the resources that overlap with US-Core. PRO FHIR IG will also leverage the Structured Data Capture (SDC) FHIR IG. In addition the IG will create profiles and extensions necessary for PRO purposes which do not exist in US-Core and SDC FHIR IG.

The next section provides a road map for the reader to walk through the implementation guide.

###  Guidance to the readers

The following table will provide a road map to the reader to follow and absorb the content of the implementation guide.
